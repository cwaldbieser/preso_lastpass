Password management can be simplified with the right tools.  The following tips
will help you effectively use LastPass to better manage your passwords.

* Creates new, secure passwords.
* Safeguards other sensitive information, e.g. credit cards.
* Identify and isolate vulnerabilities.

# Storing Passwords

## Your Master Password

* Trade-off - Memorize 1 Lastpass master password and LastPass manages the rest.
* A long passphrase is better than a complex one with special characters.
* Install the LastPass browser extension to manage passwords for various web
  sites.  This works especially well for privileged access accounts that don't
  use web single sign-on.
* You can use the LastPass vault to share and organize passwords that aren't
  for web sites.  E.g. database connections, administrative accounts for
  network gear, sudo passwords, etc.

## Pro Tip

* Don't reuse your master password anywhere else!

# Create New Passwords

* The LastPass browser extension can generate new strong passwords for you when
  you sign up or change a password for an existing web service.
* When you enter a password, LastPass will offer to store the password for you.

# Organizing and Sharing

* Sharing sensitive information across the department is easy.  Secure notes
  are extremely flexible.  More structured objects can be used when appropriate
  (e.g. database credentials).
* Thoroughness is a virtue, but order is a paramount.  Put some thought into
  organizing passwords into service team folders before sharing.
* You can request groups of members which can be used to share folders.  This
  facilitates sharing folders between teams rather than individuals.

# Identify Vulnerabilities

* Use the security dashboard to find duplicate or weak passwords and eliminate
  those.

# The End
